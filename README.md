# Boggle
This is an assignment from Stanford CS106X course
Boggle is a board game in which the player find words in a 4x4 grid of cubes each labeled with a letter by connecting adjacent cubes (can be connected in all 8 directions). More information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle
In this computerized version of boggle, the player can decide on the size of the grid and can choose to either enter the letters on the grids or generate random letters. The user then look for words in this grid, and the computer checks if each word is really in the grid. If the user gives up on the game, he/she can press enter, and then the computer displays all the words that the player failed to find.
